## Register Github

## Setup Github Authentication in Rstudio

After you have registered on GitHub, the next thing you should do is to setup your local RStudio so that it can retrieve data from and upload data to GitHub.

Tools ---\> Global Option ---\> Git/SVN

### Step 1: Make a SSH key

Click "Create SSH Key..." Leave all settings as default. You may leave "Passphrase (optional)" and "Confirm" empty.

It will open a page that lists all your existing SSH keys. Click the button "New SSH key"

It will open a page titled "Add new SSH Keys." In the "Title" field, you may input any name of your choice (preferably one that tells you which machine this key is stored). In the "Key" field, input the text you have copied in RStudio in **Step 2**.

Click the green button "Add SSH key" and GitHub will direct you back to the "SSH Key" page. If your key is added successfully, you should be able to see its title and information in the "Authentication Keys" section. You may delete it when it becomes relevant. For your account security, if you discard a device, you would definitely want to delete the SSH key associated with it.
