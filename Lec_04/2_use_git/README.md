After you have set up a *Version Control* R project following
instructions in
[1\_setup\_git](https://github.com/haohanchen/HKU_POLI3148_23Fall/tree/main/Lec_04/1_setup_git),
you can then use Rstudio to synchronize your local repository with your
online repositories on GitHub. You can perform these operations using
the “Git” panel that by default shows up at the top-left area of your
Rstudio interface. See below a screenshot of the panel.

In this note, I will introduce how you may retrieve updates from an
online GitHub repo and upload local updates to your online GitHub repo.

## Retrieve Updates from an Online Repo

To retrieve update from an online GitHub repo, simply click the blue
downward arrow. Clicking the button will render a pop-up window. When
the update is done, a line of text “Already up to date” will show up in
the pop-up window. And you will need to manually close it by clicking
“Close.”

Note that a small drop-down menu you to the right of the “Pull” button
gives you an option to “Pull with Rebase.” This is a function you should
use with extreme caution. If you choose to pull with rebase, then, the
update will **OVERWITE ALL YOUR LOCAL CHANGES**. If you are working with
a project folder that you are updating locally, doing it will cause loss
of all recent updates!

## Upload Local Updates to an Online Repo

### “Commit”

### “Push”
