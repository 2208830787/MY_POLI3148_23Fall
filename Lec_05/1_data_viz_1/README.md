In this lecture, we start our adventure in Data Visualization with R.
Data Visualization is arguably (one of) R’s most powerful and
irreplaceable functionality. A lot of data scientists (including myself)
stick with R because of R’s data visualization module.

You can find the concepts and R functionality for data visualization in
the following two books.
